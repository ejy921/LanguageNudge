LangNudge is a to-be Chrome extension that microdoses vocabulary during your day. Instead of countless pressing buttons in long study sessions, you get tiny, spaced-repetition-optimized nudges that show up in random intervals (which you can choose)!

Key Features:
- Vocab Importing: users are able to upload their own text lists, CSV files, or Anki decks
- Built-in Starter Decks: curated mini-decks for beginner Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Japanese
- Spaced Repetition Scheduling: nudges vocabulary with an evidence-based learning system!
- Quiz: you can choose to have a quiz style card instead of a flashcard, or do both
- Example Sentences: we provide an example sentence at every nudge 
- Progress Tracker: you can view how many words you went through each day!
